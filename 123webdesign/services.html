                <h3>Early Rune Farming</h3>
                <p>Runes are the main currency of Elden Ring. Runes act as the XP and purchasing currency at vendors within The Lands Between. Players will lose their Runes upon death, and a "bloodstain" is generated at the place of defeat. Returning to this place and reclaiming your runes will allow you to re-acquire them. If you perish a second time before getting there, the Runes will be lost forever. Below is a link to a video that will guide you on how to get a lot of runes early in the game.</p>

                <h3>Elden Ring Lore</h3>
                <p>When you first start Elden Ring, you will most likely be confused as to what is going on with the story. Don't worry, this is not unsual due to the fact that Elden Ring is very vague when it comes to filling you in on the story. You are basically thrown into a world with little clue as to what is going on. However, with a little digging, you will find that the lore and storyline of Elden Ring is quite in depth. This video is a great starting point to watch to get an idea of the world you are jumping into.</p>
